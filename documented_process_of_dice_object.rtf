\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Documented Process\
\
The purpose of this document is to track and provide evidence of my design process as I build a single-object dice program.\
\
# Plan\
\
The program will be made according to the objectives listed in the README and on diode.\
For the purpose of TDD (Red, Green, Refactor), I will construct an RSpec test that fails, and then build the program around the error messages, before refactoring.\
\
# Structure\
\
Dice class - My single object, which will contain all of the necessary methods to fulfil my objectives.\
Array of the numbers 1-6, passed to the roll_dice method.\
roll_dice method - Runs #sample on the array to randomly roll the dice, and stores the result as an array. May require use of the #times method to roll the necessary number of dice.\
result method - Returns the array of the value of the dice rolls\
\
# Process\
\
R - Described Dice class in RSpec, failed (NameError: uninitialised constant Dice)\
G - Initialised Dice class, passed\
